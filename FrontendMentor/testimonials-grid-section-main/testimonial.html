                  <p class="card-title title1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

                  <p class="card-subtitle sub1">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <p class="card-title title4">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p class="card-subtitle sub4">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

<article class="card-article article5">

<p class="card-title title5"> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>

<p class="card-subtitle sub5">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
100% recommend! ” </p>
